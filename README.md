#### Due to Seamless being updated to 1.8.0, this script has been removed from GitHub. This is because this update has fixed the inherent issues with the invasion spawns and hence the script is no longer needed and closer akin to cheating.


# SeamlessRespawnScript
script to get rid of vanilla seamless spawns, but in a way that shouldn't be ruining other's experiences.


Changes:
- slightly increased teleport delay after logging coordinates per seamless dev's request
- cleaned up code even more
- commented every action

Fixes:
- no longer tries to teleport to dead players
- crash fixes for invalid writes
- stuck in respawn fix

Final version, no more changes will be made
