# SeamlessRespawnScript
script to get rid of vanilla seamless spawns, but in a way that shouldn't be ruining other's experiences.


Changes:
- slightly increased teleport delay after logging coordinates per seamless dev's request
- cleaned up code even more
- commented every action

Fixes:
- no longer tries to teleport to dead players
- crash fixes for invalid writes
- stuck in respawn fix

Final version, no more changes will be made
